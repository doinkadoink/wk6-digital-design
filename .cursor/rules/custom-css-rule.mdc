# css rule content



- Always place css code into [coffee.css](mdc:coffee.css), ensuring there are no duplicate elements and that there are no conflictions with any other elements. Check for pre-existing elements that may be useful or relevant before making another, ensuring you have them labelled according to which pages they are used in.
